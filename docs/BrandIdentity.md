# iamshift.dev — Brand Identity v1.0

## 1. Brand Essence  
**shift is standard // design is craft**

At its core, `shift` represents directional intent — movement with purpose.  
`Moin` is the origin of that intent.  
The brand system communicates structure, clarity, and engineered expression.

## 2. The Identity System

### 2.1 Logomark  
A three-arm geometric symbol derived from orthogonal angular shapes.  
It is directional, structural, and engineered.

**Usage:**
- Forge Orange (#FF4E00) for brand contexts
- White/black for environmental contexts
- No tints, gradients, shadows, or rotations

### 2.2 Logotype  
Lowercase wordmark set in **Beepo** with disciplined spacing.  
Used only in specific identity moments, not for UI text.

## 3. Brand Voice  
Direct  
Precise  
Minimal  
Intentional  
Nothing ornamental; all expression is functional.
